ProSolo is a variant caller for single cell data from whole genome amplification with multiple displacement amplification (MDA). It relies on a pair of samples, where one is from an MDA single cell and the other from a bulk sample of the same cell population, sequenced with any next-generation sequencing technology.

It uses an extension of the novel latent variable model of [libprosic](https://github.com/PROSIC/libprosic), that already integrates various levels of uncertainty. It adds a layer that accounts for amplification biases (and errors) of MDA, and thereby allows to properly asses the probability of having a variant in the MDA single cell.

In the future, ProSolo will also implement indel calling, but currently, only the the `single-cell-bulk` subcommand with the `--omit-indels` flag is recommended.

## Installation

ProSolo is available via [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io), a distribution of bioinformatics software for the conda package manager.
[Bioconda can be set up](https://bioconda.github.io/#using-bioconda) in any Linux environment, even without admin rights.
With [Bioconda set up](https://bioconda.github.io/#using-bioconda), ProSolo can be installed via

	$ conda install prosolo

## Usage

For general usage, please issue `prosolo --help` on the command line. Help is also available for all subcommands listed there, e.g. `prosolo single-cell-bulk --help`.

### Variant Calling

To try out calling command syntax, please use the test data in the repo folder `tests/` as follows:
```
prosolo single-cell-bulk \
		--omit-indels \
    --candidates tests/candidates.bcf \
    --output test-out_omit-indels.bcf \
    tests/single-cell.bam \
    tests/bulk.bam \
    tests/ref.fa
```

### Controlling the false discovery rate

To control the false discovery rate (FDR) for the minimal output of the above example, use its expected output data in the repo folder `tests/` as follows:
```
prosolo control-fdr \
    tests/expected-out_omit-indels.bcf \
    --events ADO_TO_REF,ADO_TO_ALT \
    --var SNV \
    --fdr 0.04
		--output ADO_fdr_0-04.bcf
```
In this case, we are jointly controlling the FDR for all `Events` that are allele dropouts in the single cell sample. For this set of `Events`, the above command will print a BCF file with all the entries with an estimated false discovery rate below `0.04`.
