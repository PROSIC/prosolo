# Postprocessing for Single Cell Variant Calls (ProSolo)

ProSolo is a caller for single cell variants in single cell-bulk sample pairs, sequenced with any next-generation sequencing technology.
It provides a novel latent variable model that integrates various levels of uncertainty, and thereby allows to properly asses the probability of having a somatic variant in the single cell while controlling the false discovery rate.
